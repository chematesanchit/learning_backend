  <h1>Life Hacks for Engineering Students</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Keep Your Balance:</em> When juggling circuits and equations, remember to balance studies with memes and
      social vibes. It's the ultimate engineering hack!</li>
    <li><em>Cultural Coding:</em> Explore hackathons and engineering clubs. Think of them as your virtual tech
      playground!
    </li>
    <li><em>Stay Unique:</em> Be as unique as your code! Don't just follow the code, write your own. Let your ideas fly
      high like debugging drones!</li>
    <li><em>Memory Lane:</em> Document your 'Eureka' moments! They'll serve as the blueprint for your engineering
      success story.</li>
    <li><em>Engineering SOS:</em> When a buddy's CPU is overheating with assignments, lend a hand, and say, "Ctrl + Alt
      +
      Support"! Share the debug love!</li>
    <li><em>WIFI Wiz:</em> Forgot the WiFi password? The command is like the 'secret formula' for engineers: netsh wlan
      show profile WiFi-name key=clear.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, life is an open-source project - debug it, code it, and make it epic! ðŸš€</p>
